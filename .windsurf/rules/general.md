Always run all tests using cargo test before finishing your work. You do not need to run it after every single change.
Run all tests with the command "./scripts/code_standards.sh"
If working with a task list, check off tasks as you finish them, and keep the list in sync with any changes to your plans.
Follow the CSS/HTML spec, and stick to choices that fit a real browser like Chromium.
Run tests with scripts/code_standards.ps1
