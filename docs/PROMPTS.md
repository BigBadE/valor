# Styling / Testing

Run the scripts/code_standards script, fix all clippy errors, and give me a list of the 
currently failing fixtures. Each fail should have a diagnosis on why it's failing, and a 
suggestion on how to fix the issue.

## Continuing

Do the given changes, keeping the spec in mind as you do and updating the module's spec.md to keep in sync.
Only fix bugs, if something is missing an implementation, report back to me instead. Focus on production-quality fixes, not prototype placeholders or shims.
Make sure not to re-implement already existing behavior.

# Work

I want you to continue working on the (name) module, following and keeping @spec.md in sync, 
updating it according to @MODULE_SPEC_FORMAT.md
